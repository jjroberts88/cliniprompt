## Problem

A main challenge I face working in primary care is continuity across increasingly complex and fragmented clinical records. It is often difficult to create a clear overview of a patient's health journey, investigations and interventions.

## Solution

This project aims to provide a system in which clinicians can easily produce knowledge graphs for a patient presentation. The knowledge graphs will contain important information about patient encounters, investigation results and interventions as well as the relationships between these data points. Using neo4j MCP combined with an LLM agent these graphs will be directly interpretable to provide accurate summaries, insights and overviews of a patients care

## Status

I am currently completing my neo4j certification and working on an early prototype for this framework. Please get in touch if you are interested to hear more.
