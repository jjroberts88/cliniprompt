## Problem

I needed a tool to help me identify recent scientific papers relevant to the subject fields relevant to my website

## Solution

I run 4pmedicine.com - a website for exploring Predictive, Preventative, Personalised and Participatory medicine. To keep up to date with current developments I need to find the key publications in these fields. This tool was designed to work with the PubMed E-utilities api. It can retrieve titles and abstracts based on journals, date ranges and keywords. The output can be reviewed by google gemini to produce a summary of the key papers that may be of interest.

## Future developments

I am working on extending the capabilities of the pubmed MCPs currently available. Once ready I plan to deploy this as a remote MCP offering.
