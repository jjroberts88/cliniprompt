## Problem

I was asked to produce an analysis of medical transcription tools. Many of these were expensive and had limited function.

## Solution

This was one of the areas that really got me interested in the potential of AI and natural language processing. Whisper had just been released by OpenAI and I realised that I could run this locally and transcribe speech to text for free. No patient identifiable information would be sent over the internet. There were no subscriptions or licences. I found this fascinating and proceeded to make my way through many textbooks of natural language processing.

I made some basic applications with Tkinter GUIs. Some of the limiting factors were that the initial models were quite slow on my laptop at the time. There was also limited ability to do live transcription without experimenting with chunking the audio and rejoining the outputs with variable success.

From this I experimented with what has now become 'ambient voice technology'. I extracted the audio from videos on youtube of students practicing pretend patient medical consultations. I could use the transcribed conversations and extract relevant information using an LLM.

Here is my [paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6o3hu6zjbPcDDJ4fDJInGjainSs3YISsWmRixRQj3U/edit?usp=sharing) from 2023 on NLP in primary care.
