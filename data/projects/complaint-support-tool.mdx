## Problem

Responding to complaints can be a stressful and time-consuming process. There are important aspects to the content, structure and information required in clinical complaint responses. Poor quality responses can result in further escalation of a complaint and additional distress to those involved.

## Solution

I reviewed current guidance from medical defence unions on the format and content of complaint responses. I used this to produce a structured template for response letters and a detailed system prompt for the various sections (introduction, summary of events, issue 1/2/3, conclusion). This project has gone through various iterations including a LangChain-based approach in Flowise using both chatflows and multi-agent (conductor/worker) frameworks. I am currently re-framing this project to work within the recently released Claude Artifacts framework to allow easier LLM integration and a dynamic UI.
