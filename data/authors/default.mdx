Hi, I'm James. I'm a medical doctor with an interest in health informatics and AI. Thanks for visiting my tech portfolio - CliniPrompt. Please feel free to check out some of the projects I am working on in the health technology space.

## Technical Skills & Experience

I love learning new technical skills and have experience in:

- Full-stack development and deployment of AI applications (React, Python, Langchain, Flowise, n8n, Railway)
- AWS cloud architecture design and implementation
- Local/on-premise AI model deployment strategies
- Development and integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) databases in agentic AI systems
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech-to-text platform development
- Website hosting and development

## Current Focus Areas

My current areas of interest and development are Neo4j knowledge graphs (learning through their Graph Academy). Developing current work in remote MCP servers integrating with PubMed.

## Research Interests

I am also fascinated by the work of [Mobilizing Computable Biomedical Knowledge (MCBK)](https://mobilizecbk.med.umich.edu/home) and have proposed my vision for the future of biomedical computable knowledge.

If you're interested and excited about these topics too please get in touch!
